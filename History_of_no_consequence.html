                    <p>Adolf Loos is a prized architect, pioneer of Modernism, the enemy of the ornament, rapist, pedophile, and sexual abuser of minors. This project takes Loos‘ criminal and juridical history as a starting point to unfold a speculative story, in which the Leopold Museum Vienna is confronted with their own (ir)responsibility in establishing the memory of Adolf Loos. <br> The video then follows four different pathways of what that confrontation looked like, three of which are fake, one of which is true.</p>

                        <h3>What Follows is True</h3>
                        <p>On the third of September 1928, Adolf Loos, one of Vienna’s most prominent architects, was arrested in his home at the age of 57. A woman had filed charges after she heard that her neighbor’s 9-year-old daughter visited him multiple days in a row, to model and supposedly because Loos wanted to send her to Paris. <br>
                        The girl accused him of having (quote) “licked her genitalia”. On further investigation, two more girls, ages 8 and 10 came forth, stating that Loos had showed them nude pictures of other children, took his clothes off whilst being with them, that he groped them repeatedly, and forced them to oral sex and masturbation. He went as far as trying to penetrate one of the girls, but she heavily fought back under screams. <br>
                        The court hearing that followed was disclosed from the public for “protection morality and secrecy of the personal life of the accused”. 
                        Loos pleaded not guilty. To the accusations of having groped them he explained, that he stabilized them during dance lessons, and that it could have happened that he touched their genitalia, but never for sexual arousal. <br>
                        During the hearings, two psychological assessments were made on the girls, stating that their accusations are not to be trusted due to their age, because children playfully exaggerate and wrongfully interpreted the situation as being a sexual one. Both of these assessments were made by close friends of Loos. His lawyer was a former city- and council member of Vienna and another friend, Gustav Scheu. He actively manipulated media coverage on this case to defame the accusations of the girls and controlled public opinion on Loos. <br>
                        Loos was sentenced to suspended 4 months. Which meant, that he could freely go home with no further consequences.
